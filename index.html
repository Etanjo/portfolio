          <p><strong>General Information:</strong> Hello! I'm Ethan, a student at Innovation Academy Charter School. I am set to graduate in 2024. With interests in video games, movies, and music my main goal is to become a game designer. Currently I know HTML, CSS, and JS with hopes to learn C#. Outside of these creative fields, I am interested in esports and ice hockey. </p>
          <label><strong>Project Descriptions:</strong></label><ul>
            <li>The Job Offer is a choose your own adventure built entirely with HTML (and a little JS). It takes you through the path of being a young individual who gets a job offer from a mysterious tech company. Do you accept? Find out for your self from the design page.</li>
            <li>The IACS CSS Zen Garden was a project in which the class was required to make designs for a given HTML file by only altering the CSS file. These designs were compiled into one web page. My simple design, as well as many others can be found on the design page</li>
            <li>Shooting Range Incident is a simple 2D arcade-esque shooter where you control the character Alpha as he protects himself as well as everyone's favorite bartender, Bart Jenkins. Buy upgrades to survive as long as you can and rack up points to get the top of the leaderboard! A link to this game can be found on the games page.
            </li>
            <li>
              IACS Draw is my first ever web project. Its a simple drawing program that allows you to draw on a blank canvas, or on the faces of those you might know. Seriously, type Dwayne into the secret code bar. Head over to the games tab for some quick artistic fun.
